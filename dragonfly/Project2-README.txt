	Jacob Lu, jjlu05
	Platform: Windows
	Code Structure: All header files, .cpp files, and solution files are all under the dragonfly engine folder.
	I wanted to avoid subdirectory folder problems when compiling, so I decided to put everything in the same folder. I have all cpp and header files in the include folder.

	How to compile: 
	Windows (Visual Studio):
Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio 2022. It is title Lu-Jacob Project2 IMGD 3000.sln, and it is in the dragonfly folder.
Press the "Build" CTRL+SHIFT+B button or go to the "Build" menu and select "Build Solution".



NOTES FOR PROJECT2C:

THE TOP Section of game (2).cpp is the saucer shoot code. Run that section to test the saucer shoot functionality.
Everything else is just the individual tests that I made. Run whatever you feel is necessary.
